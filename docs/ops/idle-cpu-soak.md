# Idle CPU Soak Benchmark

Run a reproducible idle-CPU soak against a CAR hub to measure steady-state
resource consumption and sign off against committed budgets.

## Quick start

```bash
# From repo root with the project venv active:
make perf-idle-cpu

# Or run with a specific profile:
make perf-idle-cpu PROFILE=hub_only

# Or invoke the harness directly:
.venv/bin/python scripts/idle_cpu_soak.py --profile hub_only --verbose
```

## Profile definitions

All profiles live in the committed file **`scripts/idle_cpu_profiles.yml`**.
Each profile specifies:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `services` | Service commands the harness must launch |
| `warmup_seconds` | Seconds to wait before sampling begins |
| `duration_seconds` | Total measurement window |
| `sample_interval_seconds` | Cadence between CPU/memory snapshots |
| `health_probe` | HTTP health check target during the soak |
| `expected_owned_process_categories` | `ProcessCategory` values the harness attributes to CAR |

### Available profiles

| Profile | Topology | Budget type | Target |
|---|---|---|---|
| `hub_only` | Hub API/UI only | **Hard gate** | <5% aggregate CAR CPU |
| `hub_plus_discord` | Hub + Discord bot idle | Comparison | <8% aggregate CAR CPU |
| `hub_plus_telegram` | Hub + Telegram bot idle | Comparison | <8% aggregate CAR CPU |
| `hub_with_idle_runtime` | Hub + idle OpenCode server | Comparison | <10% aggregate CAR CPU |

### Hard gate vs comparison profiles

- **Hard gate** (`hub_only`): the benchmark **must pass** for the campaign to
  succeed.  Failure blocks downstream optimization work.
- **Comparison**: the profile is measured and recorded but does not block the
  campaign.  Data feeds regression tracking across releases.

Only `hub_only` is a hard gate in the first campaign.  Other profiles may be
promoted to hard gates in later campaigns as baselines stabilize.

## Host requirements

- **Quiet local or dedicated machine.** No competing CPU-heavy processes during
  the soak.  Close IDEs, builds, and other CAR instances before running.
- **macOS or Linux.** The harness uses `ps` / `pidstat` (Linux) or `ps` alone
  (macOS) to sample per-process CPU.
- **Python 3.10+** with the project venv active.
- **Network access** to the hub health endpoint (loopback by default).

## Artifact directory

All artifacts are written to:

```
.codex-autorunner/diagnostics/idle-cpu/
```

Each run produces one JSON file named:

```
{profile}_{timestamp}.json
```

Example: `hub_only_2026-04-17T12-00-00Z.json`.

## JSON artifact contract

Every artifact JSON file must conform to this structure (see also the
`artifact_contract` section of `scripts/idle_cpu_profiles.yml`):

## Separation from existing diagnostics

- The idle soak contract is **separate** from the live `process-monitor.json`
  time-series that the hub writes during normal operation.
- The idle soak contract is **separate** from `check.sh` validation.  It is a
  campaign-specific measurement, not a CI gate.
- The harness must not depend on `process-monitor.json` internals.

## First campaign success metric

The first optimization campaign succeeds when:

1. A `hub_only` soak produces a passing `signoff` with
   `car_owned_cpu_mean_percent < 5.0` on a quiet local or dedicated host.
2. The artifact is checked into `.codex-autorunner/diagnostics/idle-cpu/` for
   regression tracking.
3. Comparison profiles (`hub_plus_discord`, `hub_plus_telegram`,
   `hub_with_idle_runtime`) are measured and recorded but do not need to pass
   a hard gate.

This metric is the **only** success criterion for the first campaign and is now
committed in this document and the profile definitions rather than living only
in chat history.

## First campaign results (2026-04-17)

### Environment

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Platform | macOS-26.4-arm64 (Apple Silicon) |
| Python | 3.9.6 |
| CPU cores | 10 |
| Git ref | cd2b43a3-dirty |

### hub_only baseline

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| CPU mean | **0.010%** |
| CPU p95 | 0.000% |
| CPU max | 0.600% |
| RSS mean | 99.3 MB |
| RSS max | 99.3 MB |
| Samples | 59 |
| Health probes | 59/59 passed |
| **Signoff** | **PASS** (0.010% < 5.0% hard budget) |

The `hub_only` profile comfortably passes the hard budget gate at **500x under**
the 5% threshold.

### Remaining hotspots

None. The idle hub consumes effectively zero CPU during steady state. The
optimizations from tickets 420-440 (adaptive idle backoff, mtime guards,
loop attribution) reduced idle polling to negligible levels.

### Host caveats

- The harness isolates measurement to the service process tree using session/PID
  filtering. Other CAR instances on the same host are excluded from measurement.
- Results may vary on heavily loaded machines. Run on a quiet host for
  reproducible numbers.

## Guardrails decisions

### What belongs in CI

- **Harness correctness tests** (artifact schema, profile validation, signoff
  logic) run in normal CI via `tests/unit/test_idle_cpu_soak.py`,
  `tests/unit/test_cpu_sampler.py`, `tests/unit/test_idle_cpu_profiles.py`.

### What does NOT belong in CI

- **Absolute CPU budget checks** should NOT run in normal CI. They require:
  - A quiet, dedicated host
  - A 5+ minute soak window
  - No competing processes
  These are suitable for **manual operator runs** (`make perf-idle-cpu`) or
  **nightly/scheduled workflows** on dedicated hardware only.

### Recommended cadence

- Run `make perf-idle-cpu` after significant changes to the hub event loop,
  polling intervals, or reconciliation logic.
- Record artifacts in `.codex-autorunner/diagnostics/idle-cpu/history/` for
  regression tracking across releases.
